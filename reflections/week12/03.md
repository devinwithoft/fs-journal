# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?


I have the basics of data rendering down pat. At this point what stands out to me as my weakness is I just am not very fgood with styling / css classes. Im not a very well organized person normally so having to make everything line up and look just perfect is quite difficult to me. I am happy with my proress though because I know im going to pass at this rate, just likel not al the requirements.
