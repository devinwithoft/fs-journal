# Daily Reflection
One day left are you going to make it? We believe in you!ðŸ’–! Are you timeboxing appropriately? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

Im going to make it for sure! I got graded this day so I knew for sure. The only hiccup is that one of my backend functions wasnt written properly to work for the websirte (but it did pass the postman test) but fixing it took me all of 3 minutes and then I got regradd and passed which made me feel great! Happy to be passing atleast
