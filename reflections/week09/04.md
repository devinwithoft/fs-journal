## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?
SSL certificate just shows that a website is using  a secure sockets layer, which creates an encrypted link between your browser and the server so that nothing else can interfere with your connection to try and take your information
2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?
Some certificates apply to scope - wildcards allow you to certify all domains and subdomains of a website, and unified communications certificates allow you to certify multiple different websites even if the domains are different
single domain only allows for one domain

the levels of certificates go from domain validation (which just shows you own the right to use the domain) all the way up to extended validation which validates your business as well as shows the country of origin on the webpage to help prevent users from going to spam/phising sites
3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?
Well for starters, they prove that users info is safe on their website, also google will push more secure websites higher in their search index so in theory having a SSL can lead to more website traffic
