## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
Using a lot of vue components to form our pages ( having cards for objects and duplicating them through the page) also using route paramaters is a huge help, it makes it easy for us to sort data
2. What went well so far?
Our ideas all coming together, we have been able to be on the same page with a lot of stuff regarding how we want this website to look. 
3. What would you do differently? Why?
I just dont think our website ultimately looks very professional, im not good at styling myself so im not one to judge but still i wish we came together and spent more time on that so it doesnt just look like some school project
