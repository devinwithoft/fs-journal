## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?
Its a way of sending images directly to your CSS and HTML file as opposed to waiting to get them from another request. It was designed because HTTP connections back in the day could only do so much at a time and as a result images would take long to load.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?
Theyre larger than just saving the image, they make extra work on the server (have to decode images and then load images vs just loading them) and they dont save on local storage, so everytime the page loads the images manually have to be reloaded.


3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?
Because HTTP has gotten better with the rest of the technology as time as gone on, what was once an efficent way of loading images faster has ultamtely become obsolete. we no longer need to load images directly because we can do many requests at once and now we can just cache the images for continued use of a page as opposed to making constant requestes every time.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work
One thing Ive gotten a lot better on by this project work is coding as a group. When I tried partner coding before it didnt really seem to work that well and I thought perhaps it just wasnt my style but this time around working with Liam really helped me see the value in partner coding. Im for sure more of a navigator than a typer because some times my mind moves really fast and if im at the keyboard ill just go off on my own tangent writing code but having someone else write while I talk really helps me process things outloud and thus do better work
