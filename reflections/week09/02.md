> **ðŸ“– [GitHub Actions and How to Use Them](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk8-9/05-Github-Actions)**

## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?

Theyre actions that you can take on your workspace whenever something happens in your repository (if it was updated for example). These actions are stored on YAML files in the gitub workflow folders.

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?
They can help the coding process by automating things like testing code, compress images or even use it to update changes on your live website whenever someone pushes to github. Instead of doing all these things manually each time you push, this makes it easier because it can happen automatically.

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?
You can have scheduled triggers, (happen at a set time or interval), webhook triggers - which are fired from Github  but the website as opposed to your individual code you can also use external triggers to fire to your github repo, which could really be anything you want it to be.
