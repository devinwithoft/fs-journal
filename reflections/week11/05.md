# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


I really didnt get anything on the front end done for allspice, but I got the backend done and thats frankly going to be a harder thing than the front end because its so new. I feel confident with all the refeences ive had this week that the final project is going to be easy as long as I put in continous work everyday. I plan to do atlast two hours each day on saturday and sunday and have the backend done bythe time monday comes around so I only have to worry about the front end all week which I think will be considerably easier than the back end. Im excited to officialy finish this course, it been a great time filed with great people with greathelp. I know im going to knock this project out of the park and get a duck! :)
