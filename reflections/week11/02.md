## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
Primary key is what the SQL table defaults to when ordering items in side of table, a foreign key is like a virtual connection between one table to another
2. What is an `Alias`?
An alias is just a way of making a short hand way to refer to the table when making sequal statments so instead of constantly referring to table account you would say account a and then any instance of a would be referring to the accounts table


3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

SELECT 
d.*,
p.*
from doctors d
JOIN patients p ON d.patientId = patients.id
