Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment


Ive had a ton of fun in this course and I think that helped a ton with my learning. When I look back to 13 weeks ago I had absoluely no idea of what I was doing and now I feel confident that I could do any coding job really. Ofcourse I would need some training from the new company to get the specifics of what they want but I feel confident enough to navigate mvc patterns, writing typical buisiness logic and now I have a firm grasp on the back end. I am a little worried about finding work, I know a lot of that is going to rely on how much effort I put in after the class ends but I wish there was a little more optimistic of an outlook in that department.
