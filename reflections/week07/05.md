# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Ultimately I was able to finish this project with a duck which I consider a big victory. I wish I had it done sooner so I could have spent more time on styling but ultimately I was happy with the little styling I did have particulaarly that wich was conditional and related to the events. All this practice in vue is starting to make me very confident with the front end though its apparent I need a big refresher with the backend before going forard. Im sure ill get that in class
