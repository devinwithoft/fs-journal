## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
Basically when two coders work together on a project. There is a "Driver" someone who is typing on the keyboard more and the "navigator" who is focused on the overall direct of the code
2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
Having two eyes on code makes sure it is more effective the first time around, both coders can share their individual experiences so one or both can end up learning a lot more than if they just did it alone
3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
IT can add a bit of cost to the development, since two people are working together instead of just working on their own. But the benefits make up for this cost
