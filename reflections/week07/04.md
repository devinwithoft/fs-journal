## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
Last week(?) we did a lot of back and forth partner coding, with one person driving and one person naviagting. also we made sure that the UX friendl by saying what button did what and make it very apparent.
2. What went well this week?
On the solo project this week, I was really happy how easy the front end came along once the back end was done. It gave me the impression that all you need is a solid backend to support all the methods you need and then the front end becomes a lot easier
3. What would you do differently?
I struggled hard with the backend since it had been so long, I Would have started earlier and focusd more on having the back end down then I ended up having. BEcause we havent done it in so long I became somewhat out of practice.
