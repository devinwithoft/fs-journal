## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?
Scheduling your time effectively, but not wasting time on a completed object.
2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
"Eating the frog" - by doing the most daunting things first I will feel better about my work. Utilizing my "golden hour" to pick the best time to schedule most of my tasks. "Strategically quitting" - knowing to stop working on a task whenever it isnt the best use of my time / not a highest priority.
3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 
During the hackathon forsure I could have used my time better. IT would have given me an idea on how long I should spend on each part, particularly because  I have a tendency of getting very side tracked.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
This assignment was extremely difficult and I only got as far as doing two different things and getting the virtuals on them. It was good practice doing virtuals to show relationships between two objects but unfortunately I feel like we werent shown a lot of how these work so it was a bit confusing
