Linking is more flexible and scales easily with higher amounts of information by allowing for pagination. 
3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
Having to guess how many different relationships there will be between items and perhaps if one item will have more of the other item than vice versa.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
I thought this project was awesome because it utilized our previous work and allowed us to fill in the gaps on the other gregslist projects we had done. In a way it was as if someone already did the backend for us (which was technically us a couple weeeks ago) so we just had to focus on the front end. I was particularly happy because I worked extra long on the gregslist project from last time doing jobs, so I was able to get the entire thing working for this project.
