## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?
A property that exists on an object just logically but is not actually stored on a server   
2. When might you use a virtual property? 
When I want to put together two strings from an object to display on my website for instance
3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?
You cant search by them because they only exist as a result of running a function and aren't saved to any server, but rather just stored temporarily on whatever oibject they exist on.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I summarized a bit of my feelings on this project on the day 5 reflection but ill add somemore here. On the positive side, auth0 seemed to be very easy (since the account backend was basically already written for us lol) but I feel like my groups lack on communication and shared vision ultimately let to us falling short of what I would consider to be presentable work.  I do cringe at the though of having to present to the class tomorrow since its extremely half baked. I guess thats life
