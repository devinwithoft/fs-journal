# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I had a lot of fun learning about the crud methods and general back end stuff. It was a bit confusing at first but by at the end of the week I felt better about them. Im pretty upset about how my group did at the hackathon, though I know this is partially my fault too. I feel like we would have done a better job if we all committed to working longer and not just settling for "good enough", thats the way it goes sometimes though. Im hopeful that this next week will allow me to reinforce the skills from last week because I could use some more practice as we didnt do as much as we could have on the hackathon.
