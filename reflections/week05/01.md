## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?
To allow you to search an end point for data of a certain type
2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
at the end of the link you do a question and the thing you want to after it. Like this ?name=devin if you want to search by two paramters you add an ampersand
?first=like&ssecond=this
3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
if you have a lot of information in your api this would help sort it out
