# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


This was an interesting week as it was entirely focused on our capstone. I was in a movie group initially but I didnt exactly like it so when another group opened up I hopped on the opportunity immedaitely. MY new group is doing a project I feel way more interested in and we also decided to make it mobile centric - to change things up from the oft focused desk top development. We met a few times over break but I know it will be a lot of working this week to make sure everything comes together just right. I am looking forward to the final project I know it will be something awesome to show off.
