## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
Unit testing - testing smaller parts of codes in isolation
Component testing - testing the components of the vue particularly by mounting them to the DOM to make sure they are fully working
End to End testing - basically the end stage of testing once the website is built out. This testing is designed to emulate an actual user using your website to see if somehow any input accidentally triggers errors in the front or back end. 
2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
End to End testing, ultimately one will want to be absolutely sure that their website works perfectly before they go live and this kind of testing can confirm just that
3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
Unit testing, I think for easier programs it wont be as nessecary as the other testing - especially because unit testing is kind of built in to the other types of testing IE if a component doesnt work right it could easily show the program that caused the erro and you know what to fix vs testing everything before hand
