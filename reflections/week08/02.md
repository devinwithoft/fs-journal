## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?
Because you have a lot less people than a giant group, so everyone will have to come together to coordinate rather than splitting off smaller groups from a main group. Since there is a lot of work to split between smaller amounts of people it is essential to all be on the same page
2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
Communication between members will have to be more constant on a smaller team with less formal "meetings" tahn in a bigger group
3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
If you want something good done cheap it wont be fast, if you want something good done fast it wont be cheap and if you want something cheap done fast it wont be good 

Its just about accepting tradeoffs especialy in a time crunch.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work
This was the day I actually switched groups. I wasnt a big fan of the group dynamic of my first group so I think it all worked out really well and am excited to see how our final product turns out.
