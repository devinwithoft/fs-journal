Tower, because it has a lot going on showing I can work on front and back end.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work
This week we mostly spent time on a group project, I ended up switching my first group because another group opened up and I felt like the idea was less generic than the one my initial group did. I am happy that I switched over.
