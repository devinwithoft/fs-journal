2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
By testing each piece you put in at a time, you can be confident that putting all the pieces together will work on a website. its beteter to trouble shoot while code is small than try and trouble shoot once the whole website is made and try and find the one piece that messed up. It also allows confidence that the later developments on the website will work since all the basics were taken care of.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work
Today was the day when my group formed and initial idea on the project. Ultimately it changed dramatically after our pitch but I still feel quite confident with the direction we decided to go. It reflected better on what we learned thus far (using API) than the original idea of having everything being entered by the user. It will be easier to show off thus be a better porfolio piece.
