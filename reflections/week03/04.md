> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
Allowing a bunch of elements to have synced data without needing to call the same function hundreds of places after one small change is made.
2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
The location of the thing you want "observed", the thing within that location that you want to track and last, what you want to happen when a change is "observed"

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
The observer pattern is watching a part of the proxy object for changes, and when a change is made it fires a draw function which is written to update information on the dom.  It thus ties direct changes to the proxy object to the DOM in the html

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
MY partner and I really struggled with this one, even though it was kind of similair to gregs list (in terms of drawing different elements to the page), it a type of a game logic we werent able to get into. I struggled a lot with learning to use the form on this one but after being told how by Jake I think I wont have as many problems using forms in the future.
