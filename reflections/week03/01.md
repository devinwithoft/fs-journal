## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?
Ultimately it allows you to seperate your code but also be able to connect said code between different files.

2. How does export differ from export default?
Export can have multiple exports per file, whereas export default can only export one thing. It just makes it easier to export using the default becausee you only have to manage exporting one thing instead of a bunch of others.
3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
It allows you to have a ton of code on a certain project because seperating each file byy its function means the whole work space is neater. Also it allows for encapsulation, which is hiding functions from the client that you dont want them to be able to mess with in the console.
