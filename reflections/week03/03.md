## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
"Get" "set"
2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?
You have to give it something to retyrb
3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
It allows us to save a lot of different properties to the object that we use in other areas of our code. Like tying a template to our object class.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
This assignment was cool because it showed how we could use the MVC to have multiple types of pages (like we had one for homes and one for cars), and how listeners could be used to update data right away as in when we deleted a car. Also using forms the proper way with MVCs we were able to see how to best split such tasks between the controller and handler.
