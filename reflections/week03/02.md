## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
Basically it allows the code to function less as one overall unit (which is cumbersome and full of multiple moving parts at one moment, which is prone to errors) and allows things to be instead be compartmentalized and function as so.  Mostly it achives this by getting rid of shared mutable states and instead having mutable states that are only really altered one function at a time and correspond to as few  fucntions as is nessecary.
2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
