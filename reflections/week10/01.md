## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
Value type, reference type and pointer type. Value type is a typical data space type so integers beign equal to a number strings being strings etc. Reference type are like value types except they store the address where the value is stored aka int EXAMPLENAME = 500. 
2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
INT BOOL STRNG are the popular onces. The difference from javascript is in C# you have to declare what an object type is you cant just store the value without specifying which ofthe value types that it is.
3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
In reference types the value is getting saved in an address that is the name of what you save it. So the name of the variable is where it is being saved as opposed to just beign saved on the type of the thing itself
