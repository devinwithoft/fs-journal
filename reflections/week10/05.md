# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I feel good about this week, c# felt extremeley easy to learn and the SQL statements, while not fully understood by me yet, seem straightfoward enough that i can learn them after regular practice. Im nervous about the final but hopefully this prefinal gets me on the right track, ive come a long way so it would be awful if I flunked out just now so ill be sure to put in extra work to get this stuff done.
