## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
The information in a row is a single instance of a thing in the table with all its categories, where as the column of a table is all the different listings of a certain type of data across all entries in the table
2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
CREATE TABLE  
characters(
  id INT,
  name TEXT,
  age INT,
  description VARCHAR(255))
  default charset utf8;
)
3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
The first one just dletes a row from the table and the second one drops in the entire table which is a big nono.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
It was nice adding actual DB functionality to a program we wrote earlier this week. Doesnt seem like a whole lot more steps to get it actually plugged in. Again im feeling very confident with this SQL stuff i'm sure that ill go far with it and it will be second nature soon.
