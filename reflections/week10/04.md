## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
enums are strongly typed constraints. basically they are constraints using symbolic names so they are specific classes that can be assigned (one of each and only one)just allows an easy way to set a type to an object
2. How can you modify an Enum?

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
