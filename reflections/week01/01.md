## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    To allow us to track changes we've made to our code with informing comments along the way. Git also allows for easy collaboration between multiple computers or even multiple developers - as it allows each to have their own full copy of the code. 

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
One benefit of having multiple branches is that you can use one of the branches to test multiple new commits before making them part of the main branch. You could have two dramtically different versions of the branch with different methods before.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub
Git itself is a local repository, so it is only saved on the machine itself. Github is an online repository, so it allows all of these changes to be uploaded to a cloud where others can see changes and committ their own changes.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Simply saving to the computer is not a good way to save code. By using Git, we are able to see all the changes we make as we commit them and are able to go back if something ever breaks. Using Github, we are also able to let others see our step by step progress and give them a seemless process if they want to collaborate. If we did this the "old way" we would have to do a ton of saving of multiple documents and would have to manually send each of these to others. This git method saves a ton of time.
