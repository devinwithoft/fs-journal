## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
Pseudo classes are another way to select items, particularly items in a certain state - such as selecting an item that is being hovered over, or selecting one type of item before or after another specific item. I believe one of the most common ones we will use is :hover,  to change what happens on our page when a certain item is "moused over".

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
Specificity is basically the overall ranking as to which changes actually occur to a certain element on a page. If for example, you have a <div> with a color specified in line but that <div> also has a .class with another color specified, the class's color setting is more specific and will be applied first. If for some reason, that <div> has two classes each with their own seperate color, the class which is further down the CSS page will be applied, as changes are applied from the top to bottom.


3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
If you overuse the !important feature (which allows for setting the highest specificity to a rule) it could become very difficult to make changes, especially as your page grows. You would have to track every instance of !important and change it by hand, whereas simply applying classes to multiple elements in any methodical fashion allows for an easier and consistent method of changing your page up.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
The most helpful thing I got from today's assignment was learning to visualize the website I want to build before doing so. This helps show demonstrate how to set up the multiple divs that make up an HTML page. In the lab, having my divs set up properly allowed me to better understand how display: flex works and overall how an HTML page comes together.
