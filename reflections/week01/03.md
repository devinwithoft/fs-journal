## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
From the reading, the idea of keeping as few different fonts colors/font sizes as possible seems like it would be a very helpful tip in designing a webpage. Also the idea of making sure the "primary" actions on a page are made with bold colors helps drive the importance to them, whereas you can leave more "secondary" and "tertiary" actions with a subtler design. 


2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
For starters, I would check out forums like Reddit if I had very specific things I needed information for. Otherwise, websites like dribble.com could help. Another idea would to be to browse websites you regularly use (particularly if you think they look nice) so you can get an idea of what they used that worked, and what else you would change if it was up to you.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
Design influences readability and also can guide people to the most relevant actions that are on the site. It would be an awful website if it wasn't exactly clear where you want to go to take certain actions becaue your eyes are directed all over the place. The ideal website experience ought to be seemless and fast.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Writing CSS codes can be redundant, especially when only changing one or two things. Bootstrap is an extremely convienent way to apply the changes you need and just to start building a website from scratch with speed. They don't have every option for every single variable, but they have a little bit of everything - so you can get an idea of how something works, and if you feel up to it, go into CSS and further elaborate on classes.
