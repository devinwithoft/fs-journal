# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I feel like the entire week went very well. I came in basically having no idea how to code in HTML and very quickly have made 4 very solid foundations for webpages, with each getting more elaborate as the days went on. I will say it was surprising how fast I was able to do this having almost no experience. It made me extremely optimistic for the rest of the course. I had a few issues remembering which classes did what/what boostrap functions would help me on the problems i had, but ultimately I was able to remember or get just enough guidance. I consider each page I developed a victory - I know ultiamtely they arent going to be at the level that i'd want to share in a porfolio, but these are very solid building blocks that the rest of my education will build on. I know the following weeks will get harder but i'm proud with where I am at this moment :-)
