## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
To help visualize the website you want to build. Drawing out the page architecture can give a mental roadmap of how you will start coding too.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
Low-fidelity wireframes are a quick and easy way to mock up a future website, as it cares the least about detail of all three methods. Mid-fidelity wireframes have more detail to them, image blocks are properly position, text boxes are where you want them too and perhaps some of the colors/fonts will be the same as your final project . Hi-fidelity mock ups try to put every detail down so that you can copy all of it exactly for your page. All the photos, fonts, colors, spacing etc will be exactly what you want to replicate for your final site.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
I do think they are worth the effort, but only focusing on one or two. They help you give you the framework for what to build on. If you are doing work for a client, for example, it will be very important to have a fleshed out wireframe and to stick to it so you can give them exactly what they want.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Pre-planning is a very important part of coding a website. My partner and I were constantly referencing the wireframe provided, and it helped give us a lot of direction - so that we didnt have to worry about making many big choices because it was essentially all "blocked" for us before hand and we just had to provide the code to bring it to life.
