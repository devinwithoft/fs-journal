## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?
Pending Resolved and Rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
You can attach callbacks to the code rather than passing them as part of each function you want in a chain. So you only have to attach one "failure" condition to a whole string of functions rather than one failure function for each, making code far more 5.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?
'then' follows a resolved promise where as 'catch' fires the attatched promise is rejected.
