## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
It stands for Representational State Transfer. Its a set of principles for linking an API between the client and requested resource. Basically when a client requests a resource, REST principles dictate that what will be transfered to the client is a representation of the resource data within itself. 

2. What does Stateless mean?
Stateless means that basically each request made to the server by the client operates entirely on its own. There is no data saved about what a particular client has searched before or anything like that. The server exists simply to recieve requests and respond to them, independant of any other tasks it has already done.  

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
There is a unique URL (or endpoint) for a resource the client is asking for, allowing it to be identified and allow for easy access from the client.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Working with Gil on this assignment, it kind of introduced the idea to me of shared APIs, since each other group was pulling from the same API too and modifying information on it by opening notes. Learning to attach the boolean conditions to the objects (to show that they were oppened) allowed me some good ideas that followed into the check point (I had saved whether or not a temperature was celsius within the appstate.) This was our first experience with "puts" and it was a bit tricky at first but ultimately I was able to see it is just as simple as GETs are.
