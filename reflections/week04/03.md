## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?
To streamline the functionality of 'promises' by getting rid of the difficult syntax. 
2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?
Define the function as async
3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?
Like I mentioned in question 1, it just made writing promises a lot easier without having to write out a whole resolve/rejected out puts you can just have it built into the async function itself

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
A big thing I got from this assignment was learning to navagate imported data from an API. Not everything will be easy to access, in this case when I wanted to set the type of the pokemon to be visible, it was quite difficult until I realized that the type was within the results.data object as an array, so I like I would access data anywhere else I would have to specify which index of the array I would want in my model while building it out.
