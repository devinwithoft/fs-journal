> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?
Essentially a very messy code with tons of conditionals and callbacks written as if its to read top to bottom. It makes the code very daunting to look at and harder for new comers to understand.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
Async is a way of putting the function on "hold" until other things are created. You can have a code running off the back that awaits another call back to fire before executing the code in its function. Allowing you to break up your code.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`
1 Simplify your code as much as possible
2 break related pieces of code into their own pages
3 set up your callback functions to announce if an error has occured so that they stop running and show you exactly where you need to address your code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Although I didnt finish the game logic with this one I had fun with converting the API into objects and felt especially smart how I grouped the objects into arrays so they could be randomized. I cant wait to see what other stuff I pick up by the end of the week
