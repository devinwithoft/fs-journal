Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This project was very frustrating. I spent a lot of time on it and was proud of it and was crushed because I missed one point. I had built functionality on my home page and search page but didnt realize it was required for the profile portion. This made me upset because I could have easily done this if I had known it makes me feel like I wasted my time trying my best when I could have just done the bare minimum and basically ended up in the same place as I am now. I am happy im learning vue and im sure that will in the end
