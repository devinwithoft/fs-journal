## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
You can write styling information to the console using elements>styles tab. This is great for testing out different CSS class properties to see what looks best. Under the console tab, there is a blank console you can enter in which is ideal for testing out javascript functionality on your page.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The elements tab, you can manually change html and css files within it to see how things would look if tweaked. The changes reset on refresh, but you can take what you like and add it to your own code.


3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code? Inserting breakpoints, or adding in debuggers manually via javascript, allowing you to go step by step in testing each line of code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
This assignment helped me understand the idea of drawing things to the page using javascript. Its quite similair to just writing it out in .html since the formatting remains the same and you are just tying it to an event in javascript. I used it for rendering my icecream store in the project, although after the fact it seems like this wasnt that nessecary of a step to take since it was such few items.
