## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?  function declaration

function example(){

}

function expression

const example = function(){

}

arrow functions
let example = (a) => {
    if (a > 1){
        return "true"}
}

The top two act just the same, the bottom one is a little different, because it will automatically return the thing after the arrow. im not 100% sure on this to be honest

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Paramaters are the words initially put into the function as a type of placeholder, whereas arguments are what replace the parameters when the function is actually invoked

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
Functions that use other functions as paramaters or functions that return functions as a result of running. I believe an example we used a lot this week are the forEach functions we've used to iterate over our arrays to change/pull up data. Often inside we put anonymous functions.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Parameters are extremely useful in functions and can save you from having to write 5 slightly-different version of the same code. Particularly with the sorting items today, I was suprised at how just changing the parameter into different strings could make one of my functions. It also saved me a lot of time attaching the function to different buttons, I will try to write these type of functions as often is appropriate for what I am working on.
