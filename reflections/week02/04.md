## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code? It gives you a plan of what you want to do, so you can just focus on how you want the code to work VS sitting down and having to think of what you want the code to do while simultaneously wondering how to make the code work. It allows you to better focus your attention on one item (specifically - one item at a time)

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
Google, there is a huge swath of knowledge at all levels and for all sorts of things. Ive already used it plenty in this course.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
That taking it slow and simple is one of the best ways to code. I have a tendency to try and do tons of things at once, and very fast. This will be very detrimental to my coding. Im better off taking the time before hand to build a rough road map, focusing on one code at a time (with emphasis on writing as few lines as possible), and making sure to have tons of tests along the way to make sure every thing is going as planned.
