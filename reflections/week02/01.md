## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
A scope is where a variable is set for. If its set for the entire document (by not being in curly brackets) its global, if its part of a function its local

2. What is Hoisting ?
Setting a variable within a function will mean that the function automatically reads that line first, regardless of where it is literally written inside the code.


3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
I would use const for an object that I still wanted to change the key:values of, since no other part of it can be redeclared or updated. I would use Let a majority of the time since it is most flexible. I would use var mostly if I didnt plan to update it much and had multiple functions to edit it, understanding that any update would be global. So if it was just one thing i was changing multiple times to the page overall I would use it. For example, if I had one number and had multiple functions to grow/shrink it and wanted the number to stay that way through each change I would use var. Not quite sure how that would play out in a project though.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Something I struggled with in this first javascript assignment was simply knowing which words to capitilize. I must have spent 25 minutes minimum on something that would have been fixed by simply capitilizing a word in the code. Coming from HTML, where this wasnt as strict, I know going forward I will need to pay extreme attention to the casing so that I can avoid any simple errors like these.
