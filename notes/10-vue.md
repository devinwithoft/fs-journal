# MVC

hardly use html anymore


pages and components

services remain the same

appstate a little different but remains the same

model is different


controllers become components


components have 3 parts
1. <template></template>
2. <script>javascript</script>
3. <style>

debug console  

@click

import {ref} from 'vue'
vuePoints: ref(0) 


in app state
vuePoints: computed(() => AppState.vuePoints) 
tempa


for anything to reach 
return appstate

dont define async inside of return.
